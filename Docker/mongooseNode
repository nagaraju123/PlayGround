Mongoose:-

	
	Mocha:- It is one type of testing framework which is supported by Nodejs.
			It is having two methods called "describe" and "it".
			Both functions will take two parameters first one is string and second one is function which we need to run in that test.
			
				Syntax:- describe("string",()=>{
							it("string",()=>{
							
							});	
						 });
			If we want to execute any functions we need to write it in "it" function
			To execute these functions we need package called "assert". It is provided by mocha package.
				Ex:- describe("string",()=>{
							it("string",()=>{
								assert(1+1==2);
							});	
						 });
			If we want to run these steps we need to add the script inside package.json file. We need to set command as "mocha".
				Ex:-  scripts:{  "test":"mocha" }  This will run when we are calling npm run test.
				
			If we dont want to run some tests which we created we need to replace "it" with "xit". Then it will skips that particular test. It will 
			skips only this one. And remaining tests will run as it is.

			If we have more number of tests in our project if we want to run only specific one we need to replace "it" with "it.only". Then it will 
			take only that particular test to run. Remaining it will ignores	
				
	Update Mehotds in Mongoose:-
		2 ways 
			1. Model Instance 
				1. update 
				2. set and save 
			2. Model Class 
				1. update
				2. findOneAndUpdate
				3. findByIdAndUpdate
				
	Deleting Records in Mongoose:-			
		2 ways 
			1. Model Instance 
				1. remove 
				
			2. Model Class 
				1. remove
				2. findOneAndRemove
				3. findByIdAndRemove		
				
	Virtual Types:-	It is named as properties which we dont need to store it in our database. 
					And need to get some values for that. For example if we have some arrays in collection. We need to get properties length.
					And these Vitual Types will works on ES6 getter and setter methods.


	Associations:- These are also name it as relations. 
	 For example one collection is having relation with child collection. While fetching if we want to fetch details of that subcollection
	 We need to use function called ".populate('<Peroperty name which we declared at time of schema declation>')"
	 
	
	Middleware:- Mongoose will come up with some of middlewares which we can use before and after of every CRUD operation performed.
		These operations will performed on ModelSchema.
