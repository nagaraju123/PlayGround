Jenkins:- 
	It is an open source to deploy our code into servers.
	It requires JAVA in our system where we are installing jenkins.
	
  Basic:-
	Jenkins is an open source automation server written in JAVA.
	It is used to detects changes in Subverision or GIT .., perform tasks, repeatedly. Like(Build,Test,Deploy,Package,Integrate).
	A Fork of origional Hudson Project.
	It has a plug in extensibility.
	It is under developement since 2005.
	Official web site   http://jenkins.io
 
 Contineous Integratation (CI):-
	CI server contineously integrates newly checked in code into a build.
	It will runs a tests and rejects the build if they failes.
    And also it will deploys build to other servers.
    And this process is also called it as a "build automation".
    Some of the benefits from Jenkins are 
		. Immeadiate Bug detection
		. No integration step in the life cycle.
		. a Deployable system at any given point
		. Record of evaluation of the project.
		. Detect system developement problems earlier.
		. Reduces risk of cost , schedule and budget.
		. Measurable and visible code quality.
  
  Why do we need Jenkins:-
	Jenkins plugins extensibility makes jenkins to adapt to many system
	Jenkins provides everything for a robust contineous integration system which helps a lot for team that practice Agile methodoly.
	Jenkins contineously providing access to the working copies of software which supports the Agile methodoly principle.
	It is released under MIT License.
	There is large support community and through documentation.
	It is very easy to write plugins.

  Installation of Jenkins:-
	Go to jenkins.io and click on download and select LTS support version.
